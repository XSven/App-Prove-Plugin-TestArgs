This

  name: "%s (%a)
  scripts:
    t/foo.t:
      - alias: "Foo once"
        args:  [foo, bar]
      - alias: "Foo twice"
      - alias: "Foo thrice"
        args:  [baz]

is an alternative config.yml layout. The test script names are the keys of
the "scripts" property. The "name" property specifies a way how a test name
should be built. The conversion "%s" refers to the test script name ("t/foo.t").
the conversion "%a" refers to the test alias name ("Foo once", "Foo twice",
and so on). The CPAN module String::Format could be used to build the test
script name.
