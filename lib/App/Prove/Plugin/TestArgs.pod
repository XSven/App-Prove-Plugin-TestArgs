=head1 NAME

App::Prove::Plugin::TestArgs - A prove plugin to configure test aliases and
arguments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # command-line 
  prove -PTestArgs=t/config.yml

  # t/config.yml
  ---
  t/foo.t:
    - alias: "Foo once"
      args:  [foo, bar]
    - alias: "Foo twice"
    - alias: "Foo thrice"
      args:  [baz]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<TAP::Harness> is the default test harness of the C<prove> command-line test
driver program. The harness has a C<test_args> object attribute that allows us
to pass different arguments to test scripts. Furthermore the harness
C<runtests()> object method implementation allows us to run a test script
multiple times giving each run a unique name (an alias).  Unfortunately it
seems to be impossible to control this functionality directly via the C<prove>
interface.

This plugin allows you to assign multiple alias-argument pairs to a test
script.  Each pair triggers a separate run of the test script. The argument
part of an alias-argument pair is optional. For the time being the
configuration has to be stored in a YAML file that is the only argument passed
to the plugin.
