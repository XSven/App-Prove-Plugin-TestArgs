App::Prove::Plugin::TestArgs - A prove plugin to configure test aliases and
arguments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    - alias: "foo once"
      args:  [ABC, DEF]
    - alias: "foo twice"
    - alias: "foo thrice"
      args:  [GHI]

  # command-line 
  prove -PTestArgs=t/config.yml --verbose t/foo.t t/bar.t :: UVW XYZ
  foo once ....
  1..1
  # ['ABC','DEF']
  ok 1 - t/foo.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<TAP::Harness> is the default test harness of the C<prove> command-line test
driver program. The harness has a C<test_args> object attribute that allows us
to pass different arguments to test scripts. Furthermore the harness
C<runtests()> object method implementation helps us to run a test script
multiple times giving each run a unique test name (an C<alias>).  Unfortunately
it seems to be impossible to control this feature directly via the C<prove>
command-line interface.

This plugin allows us to assign multiple C<alias>-C<args> pairs to a test
script.  Each pair triggers a separate run of the test script. The C<args> part
of a pair is optional. If it is missing, C<prove>'s own optional test script
arguments passed at the command-line after an arisdottle (C<::>) are used as a
default.

For the time being the configuration has to be stored in a YAML file that is
the only argument passed to this plugin.

C<prove>'s test output no longer shows the test script names, if test aliases
are configured. As of version C<2.1.0> this plugin provides an alternative
configuration scheme that helps us to overcome this drawback.
